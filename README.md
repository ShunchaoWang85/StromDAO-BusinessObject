  StromDAO: Consensus System for Energy Blockchain	
    Usecase: Connect new Meterpoint to Consensus System
      ✓ Test Ownership of Consensus (deployed as prerequesit) (117ms)
        - My DSO: 0x7a0134578718b171168A7Cf73b861662E945a4D3
      ✓ Ensure DSO Contract exists
        - My MPO: 0xc4719B91742D052d0A93F513f59F6Ac15e95D061
      ✓ Ensure MPO Contract exists
        - My Provider: 0xd457F18DB9949899263d5bEbd74e74Ef6d2a6624
      ✓ Ensure Provider Contract exists
      ✓ Test if consensus is aware of MPO Role (address) (44ms)
      ✓ Test if consensus is aware of DSO Role (address) (46ms)
      ✓ Test if consensus is aware of Provider Role (address) (46ms)
      ✓ Let MPO become my MPO by setting contract in roles (4255ms)
      ✓ Let DSO become my DSO by setting contract in roles (8192ms)
      ✓ @MPO: Approve myself as MeterPoint (Role 4) (12340ms)
      ✓ @DSO: Approve myself as Connection (8289ms)
    Usecase: Process sequential Meterpoint readings
      ✓ Set my reading #1 according to MPO contract (12216ms)
      ✓ Set my reading #2 according to MPO contract (8229ms)
      ✓ Retrieve my last Delivery (67ms)
      ✓ Check that I am owner of last Delivery (65ms)
      ✓ Set my reading #3 according to MPO contract (8269ms)
      ✓ Retrieve my last Delivery - should be different to first (52ms)
    Usecase: Consensus of Power Delivery is given after exchange (merge/resolve)
      ✓ Sumup energy in deliveries - should be eq to reading 3 - reading 1 (114ms)
      ✓ Transfer Ownership of Delivery 2 to Delivery 1 (12224ms)
      ✓ Check that Delivery 1 got Ownership (55ms)
      ✓ Include Delivery 2 into 1  (8226ms)
      ✓ Re-Sumup energy in deliveries - should be eq to reading 3 - reading 1 (98ms)
      ✓ Delivery 2 should have power eq 0 (45ms)
    Usecase: Delegation of Deliveries
      ✓ Let DSO become my Provider by setting contract in roles (12215ms)
      ✓ Set my reading #4 according to MPO contract (8228ms)
      ✓ Retrieve my last Delivery (50ms)
      ✓ Check that DSO is owner of last Delivery (45ms)
      ✓ Let TestProvider become my Provider by setting contract in roles (8191ms)
      ✓ Set my reading #5 according to MPO contract (12204ms)
    Usecase: Provider does energy to money exchange
      ✓ Let Provider accept deliveries from me as sender with cost per day 0 and cost per energy 2 (8256ms)
      ✓ Retrieve my last Delivery (59ms)
      ✓ Retrieve Stromkonto (49ms)
      ✓ Check my due eq 0 on Stromkonto (61ms)
      ✓ Sign Billing Contract with Provider (12306ms)
      ✓ Let provider handle my last delivery (8209ms)
      ✓ Check my due is double energy on Stromkonto as cost per energy is set to 2 (reading#5-reading#4)*2 (132ms)

## Hello-World Sample
Create a "mytest.js" file with:

```javascript
var StromDAOBO = require("stromdao-businessobject");    
var external_id = Math.random()*10000000; 
var node = new StromDAOBO.Node({external_id:external_id,testMode:true});

var my_reading_1=Math.round(Math.random()*10000000);


// Parameters of Consensus-System
var known_rolelookup = '0xbc723c385dB9FC5E82e301b8A7aa45819E4c3e8B';

// Deploy Meter-Point-Contract if it does not exist ...
node._deployContract('StromDAO-BO.sol:MPO',known_rolelookup)
	.then(function(my_mpo) { 
		    console.log("MPO Address",my_mpo);		    
		    var p1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
				node.mpo(my_mpo).then( function(mpo) {
									resolve(mpo);
				});
			});
		    return p1;
		  })
	.then(function(mpo) {   //With instance of MPO Contract
	    var p1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
	      mpo.approveMP(node.wallet.address,4).then( function(tx_result) {   //aprove MP
			  resolve(mpo);
		  });
	   	});
	    return p1;	
	   }); 
```

Test it with
```
node mytest.js
```

What this Hello-World does is creating a new MeterPoint derived from a random id (external_id). Signs conract for Meter-Point-Operations and confirms (counter-sign by MPO).
